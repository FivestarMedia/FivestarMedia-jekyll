					<h2>1. SEO Audit</h2>
					<h3>The first step of the SEO process is understand the starting position of your site within search engines. We analyze the current traffic your site is getting along with relevant site statistics (keywords, bounce rates, etc.). Understanding the traffic level and its source of referrals helps in making other online marketing decisions.</h3>

								<h2>2. Keyword and Market Research</h2>
								<h3>Next, we identify a set of keyword phrases that will be used for optimization. This important step requires balancing two important factors: high usage by searchers and relatively low competition within search engines. This ensures that your site is built to be found with searchers in mind.</h3>
								<h3>Using the target keyword phrases, we do a competitive analysis of your site against its biggest competitors. We use a variety of SEO metrics including indexed content, Alexa rating, inbound links, domain age, social media following among others.</h3>
								<h3>From this, we are able to gauge your site's starting position relative to your competitors, exploit their weaknesses and adjust the SEO plan accordingly.</h3>

						<h2>3. Goal Setting</h2>
						<h3>Once we have a snapshot of your site's starting position, we set goals for the SEO plan. These goals are measurable	and relate to the specific business objectives of the site. In the ongoing process of Conversion Rate Optimization, progress towards the goals are analyzed and if required, adjusted accordingly.</h3>

						<h2>4. Page Optimization</h2>
						<h3>This process involves ensuring all elements that make up the content of every page within your site are related to the content itself. Elements include keywords, title tag, description tag, headings, internal linking, website structure and other factors. Images are also compressed and redundant code is removed for increased page load speed.</h3>
						<h3>As the content on each page is different throughout your site, this is done individually for each page for optimal results.</h3>
