				<h1>PPC Benefits</h1>
				<h3>Pay-per-click marketing allows your company to advertise in a fast, cost-effective and highly targeted manner on the
					internet to generate quality leads. Whereas SEO is generally a long-term lead generation strategy, PPC allows even recently
					launched websites to acquire new leads from potential clients.</h3>
				<!-- <h3>At Fivestar Media, we know the best websites should engage the user with compelling content balanced with eye-catching visuals. The website should be optimized to rank well with search engines, work seamlessly across all devices and be easy to use with a fast load time.</h3> -->

					<h2>1. Fast Results</h2>
					<h3>You can get up and running quickly with PPC. Compared with SEO which can take several months for tangible results, with
						PPC the results are instant within minutes of launching your campaign.</h3>
					<h3>PPC allows you to quickly cast a wide net to help you find new leads and customers.</h3>
					<h3>Compared to other methods such as email and social media marketing, PPC allows you to target people outside of those
						who are already aware of your brand and doesn't limit to you to existing followers or customers.</h3>

					<h2>2. Highly Targeted</h2>
					<h3>PPC allows you to target your potential clients based on specific criteria such as location, time, day of week and many
						other options.</h3>
					<h3>In doing such, you get to filter potential clients to your criteria.</h3>
					<h3>This includes both targeting keywords through text ads and running ads through remarketing based on past behaviours.</h3>

					<h2>3. Under Your Control</h2>
					<h3>While there are several nuances regarding campaign settings, PPC gives you ultimate control over a wide range of options
						on how you reach potential clients. This starts with keyword placement and how restrictive you want to be.</h3>
					<h3>If you want to start small, you have a lot of budget flexibility. If you're seeing positive results, you can scale up
						immediately and if you want to take a break, you can pause your campaign immediately. This level of control is hard
						to do with other advertising channels.</h3>

					<h2>4. Measurable</h2>
					<h3>One of the biggest benefits of PPC advertising with Google AdWords is that it's easy to measure and track: simply link
						the AdWords tool together with Google Analytics.</h3>
					<h3>You'll get all high-level performance statistics including impressions, clicks and conversions. It's easy to determine
						how your campaigns are performing and which keywords are driving your traffic, which isn't as obvious in other advertising
						channels.</h3>

					<h2>5. Marketing Data</h2>
					<h3>PPC gives you a wealth of marketing data beyond even whats available directly in Google AdWords. PPC data from impression,
						click and conversion can further refine a website's SEO strategy.</h3>
					<h3>You can also integrate third-party tools to guage where your competition is to help you learn how much market share
						you can gain.</h3>
